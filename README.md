* Python 3.9.13
* Sign up and get an api key from https://apilayer.com/marketplace/fixer-api

First run
```sh
poetry install

this should create a new virtual environment located in `.venv` or `venv` directory
(depending on how poetry config is set up).
## Run the service locally
```sh
poetry run python -m currency

## Objectives
* To improve this service however you see fit.
* This should be timeboxed to around 1-2 hours.
